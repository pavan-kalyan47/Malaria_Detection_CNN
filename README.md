Malaria Detection Using Neural Networks
### Description
#### This project aims to detect malaria from microscopic cell images using deep learning techniques. By leveraging Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and tools like TensorFlow and Weights & Biases (W&B), this project demonstrates a streamlined process for data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and hyperparameter optimization.

### Features
#### Efficient preprocessing of malaria cell images.
#### Implementation of a LeNet-based CNN architecture for image classification.
#### Performance tracking and optimization using W&B sweeps.
#### Evaluation with metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and AUC (Area Under the Curve).
